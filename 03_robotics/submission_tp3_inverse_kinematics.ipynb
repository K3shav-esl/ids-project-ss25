    "# Task 2.1 Inverse Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining Joint Angles from End-Effector Position\n",
    "\n",
    "To move the robots end-effector point $T$ to a desired target position ($x_T$, $y_T$) we need to calculate the **joint angles** ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$). This process is known as **inverse kinematics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental task is to reverse the relationships established in direct kinematics. Based on the provided direct kinematics, points $R$, $M$, and $T$ are derived from point $Q$ by simple vertical offsets involving the rope length $L_3$ and the object's radius $r$. Therefore, the first step in inverse kinematics is to determine the coordinates of point $Q = (Q_x, Q_y)$ from the given target point $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Determining the Effective Target Point $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the coordinates of the target point $T = (x_T, y_T)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical offset from $Q$ to $T$ is $L_3 + 2r$. To find $Q$'s coordinates, we simply reverse this offset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_x = x_T$$\n",
    "$$Q_y = y_T + (L_3 + 2r)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $Q = (Q_x, Q_y)$ serves as our effective target point for the two-link arm ($L_1$, $L_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Calculating the Elbow Angle ($\\beta$)\n",
    "\n",
    "From direct kinematics the formula for the end-effector position is already known:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_x = L_1 \\cos(\\alpha) + L_2 \\cos(\\alpha + \\beta)$$\n",
    "$$Q_y = L_1 \\sin(\\alpha) + L_2 \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Aiming to eliminate $\\alpha$ from the equation we square and add both equations which in the end leads to: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_x^2 + Q_y^2 = L_1^2 + L_2^2 + 2 L_1 L_2 \\cos(\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging to solve for $\\cos(\\beta)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\cos(\\beta) = \\frac{Q_x^2 + Q_y^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $\\beta$, we use the arctangent function. Note that for a given $\\cos(\\beta)$, there are generally two possible solutions for $\\beta$ (corresponding to \"elbow up\" and \"elbow down\"). To achieve the \"elbow down\" configuration (as often desired for stability or workspace constraints), we select the negative value for $\\sin(\\beta)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sin(\\beta) = -\\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2(\\beta)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, $\\beta$ is calculated using the `atan2` function, which correctly places the angle in the appropriate quadrant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta = \\text{atan2}(\\sin(\\beta), \\cos(\\beta))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Reachability**: If the calculated value of $\\cos(\\beta)$ is outside the range $[-1, 1]$, the target point $Q$ is beyond the robot's physical reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Calculating the Shoulder Angle ($\\alpha$)\n",
    "\n",
    "With $\\beta$ determined, we can now compute the shoulder joint angle $\\alpha$ using a geometric approach based on triangle construction. First, compute the angle of the vector from the origin to point $Q = (Q_x, Q_y)$:\n",
    "$$\\text{atan2}(Q_y,Q_x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, compute a correction angle based on the triangle formed by the two links and the vector to $Q$. This correction accounts for how the second link (of length $L_2$) bends at the elbow with angle $\\gamma$:\n",
    "$$\\text{atan2}(L_2\\sin⁡(\\beta),L_1+L_2\\cos⁡(\\beta))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The shoulder angle $\\alpha$ is then given by subtracting the correction from the overall direction to $Q$:\n",
    "$$\\alpha = \\text{atan2}(Q_y, Q_x) - \\text{atan2}(L_2 \\sin(\\beta), L_1 + L_2 \\cos(\\beta))$$"

    "    Once the gripper successfully reaches the `pick_location`, the robot system will automatically detect the object and simulate picking it up. You don't need to write code for the grasping action itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Define Waypoints to the Drop-off Spot:**\n",
    "    After picking, you'll define another sequence of points to move the robot, with the object, **above** the `place_location` (where you want to drop it), and then **down to** that spot. Make sure to plan your path to avoid obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Automatic Placing:**\n",
